# proofs

Random proofs.

## Setup

Check the `.envrc` file.

## Wtf

I'm using [alectryon](https://systemf.epfl.ch/blog/alectryon/) for literate programming.

The idea is to have [Latex proofs](https://cpitclaudel.github.io/alectryon-sle2020-talk/#/step-12) side by side with Coq proofs.
Because "plain proof scripts are essentially incomprehensible" without
going through them line by line using interactive theorem prover.

See [the alectryon paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3426425.3426940) for more info.
